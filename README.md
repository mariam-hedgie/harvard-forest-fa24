# Harvard Forest COâ‚‚ Flux Analysis

This is my college python class' projectd

This project analyzes long-term COâ‚‚ flux data from the Harvard Forest eddy flux tower. The goal is to understand how environmental conditions such as temperature, radiation, and wind affect COâ‚‚ uptake and release in forest ecosystems.

## ðŸŒ² Project Context

Forests play a critical role in regulating the global carbon cycle. This analysis uses real-world data collected at Harvard Forest â€” the oldest eddy flux tower in the world â€” to model and visualize carbon flux patterns over time.

## ðŸ§ª Tasks Overview

### 1. Data Reading & Summary
- `readdata(filename)`: Loads the dataset from a `.csv` file.
- `summarizedata(hf)`: Plots the COâ‚‚ time series and summarizes key statistics.

### 2. Missing Data Analysis
- `missingdata(hf)`: Calculates and visualizes the percentage of missing data per year.

### 3. Seasonal Patterns
- `seasonalcycle(hf)`: Visualizes monthly average COâ‚‚ fluxes from 1995â€“2000.

### 4. Regression Modeling
- `HFregression(hf)`: Builds a regression model to predict COâ‚‚ flux from:
  - Net radiation  
  - Air temperature  
  - Water vapor  
  - Wind speed

### 5. Model Visualization
- Compares actual COâ‚‚ data with model predictions.
- Shows the contribution of each variable over time.

### 6. Long-Term Trends
- `averagecarbon(hf, modelest)`: Plots annual average modeled COâ‚‚ flux to assess whether the forest is a net sink or source.

## ðŸ“Š Outputs

This repository includes:
- `projectd.py`: Full project code
- `timeseries.png`: COâ‚‚ time series plot
- `missingdata.png`: Missing data per year
- `monthlyflux.png`: Monthly flux patterns
- `modelcomparison.png`: Model vs. data visualization
- `avgflux.png`: Yearly average modeled flux

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insight

Negative COâ‚‚ flux values indicate forest **carbon uptake** (sink), while positive values indicate **release** (source). This analysis highlights how seasonal and yearly climate patterns influence forest carbon dynamics.
